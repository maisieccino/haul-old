# haul

Your knowledge store.

The idea of haul is to provide an API for storing, retreiving, and
manipulating your own store of information, whatever that may be.

Your haul is made up of data blocks, known as _things_. There are a number of
different type of things. Some thing types might act as aggregates for more
things, such as the _page_ type.

Things in your haul are stored in bags. Bags are a bit like
files/directories, but a bit more general. Eventually you'll be able to
define access control rules for your bags.

Your things are also sorted by labels, which act as tags. You can assign your
things as many or as few labels as you like, and use them however you like.
